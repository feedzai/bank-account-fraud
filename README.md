# `bank-account-fraud`: Tabular Dataset(s) for Fraud Detection under Multiple Bias Conditions

## Abstract

Evaluating new ML techniques on realistic datasets plays a crucial role in the development of ML research and broader adoption by practitioners. Furthermore, with the growing ethical concerns around the potential of bias in algorithmic decision-making, fairness evaluation is becoming a standard practice in ML. However, while there has been a significant increase of publicly available unstructured datasets for computer vision and NLP tasks, there is still a lack of large-scale domain-specific tabular datasets, which hinders potential research applied to this particular domain. Additionally, many high-stakes decision-making applications, where an accurate evaluation of algorithmic fairness is of paramount importance, rely on this type of data. Ultimately, this affects the quality of the deployed models in critical applications, and consequently, automated decisions applied to people. To tackle this issue, we present `bank-account-fraud`, the first publicly available, large-scale, and privacy-preserving suite of tabular datasets for fraud detection. The suite was generated by applying state-of-the-art tabular dataset generation techniques on an anonymized, real-world bank account opening application dataset. This setting carries a set of challenges that are commonplace in real world applications, including distribution shifts in time and significant class imbalance. Additionally, to allow practitioners to `stress test` both performance and fairness of ML methods in dynamic environments, each dataset variant of the presented suite depicts a specific predetermined and controlled type of data bias, including time-related patterns. With this dataset, we hope to potentiate ML research, through a more realistic, complete and robust test bed for novel and existing ML methods.
